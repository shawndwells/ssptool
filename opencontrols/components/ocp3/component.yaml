        'The customer will be responsible for automatically auditing account
        management actions. A successful control response will need to address
        all automated mechanisms involved in monitoring account management,
        the personnel or roles that must be notified of account management
        activities, and the means by which notifications occur.

        OpenShift will log events to standardized files, however automatic
        notification (outside of generating  audit data) is not possible. As an
        OpenShift Container Platform cluster administrator, you can deploy the
        EFK stack to aggregate logs for a range of OpenShift Container Platform
        services and setup alerting.

        Application developers can view the logs of the projects for which they
        have view access. The EFK stack aggregates logs from hosts and
        applications, whether coming from multiple containers or even deleted
        pods.

        For documentation on how to setup Elasticsearch, Fluentd, and Kibana,
        refer to the Aggregate Logging" section of the OpenShift Installation
        and Configuration Guide:

        'Authorization policies determine whether a user is allowed to perform
        a given action within an OpenShift project. This allows platform
        administrators to use policy to control who has various access levels
        to the OpenShift Container Platform itself and all projects. It also
        allows developers to use local policy to control who has access to
        their projects. Note that authorization is a separate step from
        authentication, which is more about determining the identity of who
        is taking the action.

        Documentation of OpenShift authorization frameworks and policies 
        can be found in the OpenShift Architecture documentation:

        https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.3/architecture/

        policy bindings. This section should be updated with deployment
        specific details on how the authorization policy has been
        configured.'

        Within OpenShift, the Elasticsearch, Fluentd, and Kibana (EFK) stack
        aggregates logs from nodes and applications running inside your OpenShift
        Enterprise installation. Once deployed it uses Fluentd to aggregate logs
        from all nodes, projects, and pods into Elasticsearch. OpenShift also
        provides a centralized Kibana web UI where users and administrators can
        create rich visualizations and dashboards with aggregated data.

        To properly plan for audit log retention, refer to "Storage Considerations"
        of the OpenShift installation and configuration guide. Production
        installations often generate in excess of 50GB/day of audit information.

#       In Red Hat's OpenControl content CM-2 is handled at the PMO level,
#       however it's best to double check with the Information System owner
#       on expectations (component vs central CM).

#       handle configuration management the lines below can be uncommented:

        OpenShift provides a plugable authentication architecture that can

        authentication. The authentication subsystem in OpenShift relies on
        OAuth 2.0 and any system that can interact with the OAuth token service
        over HTTPS can recieve authentication tokens. Typically this is
        implemented using OpenShift-provided RequestHeaderIdentityProvider as
        described in Section 12.3.8, Request Header, of the OpenShift v3.3
        Installation and Configuration Guide:

##  IR-4 (2) is *technically* an organizational control, however
##  many accreditors/auditors will want to understand how the
##  system component integrates with dynamic reconfiguration capabilities.
##  Lacking formal guidance from the government, some auditors expect a
##  response to this control at the component level.

##  application servers, to provide a description of the functional
##  properties of the security controls to be deployed.
##
##  A a generally accepted control response is to provide a security
##  configuration guide, such as a NIST National Checklist or DoD
##  STIG, for the component.
##
##  In absense of an approved government configuration baseline,
##  note this requirement is satisfied by a *description* of
##  functional properties. Implimentation details are offered in

##    - Provide design and implementation regarding security-relevant
##      external system interfaces and high-level design;
##    - Provide design and implementation information required by the
